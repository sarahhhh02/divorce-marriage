1,"Sources: Statistics Canada, Canadian Vital Statistics – Marriage Database and Estimates of population, by marital status or legal marital status, age and sex for July 1, Canada, provinces and territories.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"At each release of marriage statistics, data from previous years may be revised to reflect any change in methodology as well as updates that have been received from the provincial and territorial vital statistics registrars.  As a consequence, data in this table may differ from those released previously.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,The 2019 and 2020 data are considered preliminary. The number of marriages as well as marriage rates could be underestimated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,Imputation was used to replace the few missing values present in the original databases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,This table includes all marriages registered in Canada regardless of whether the new spouses' usual place of residence was in Canada or another country. Marriages of Canadian residents that were registered abroad are not included.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,The following standard symbols are used in this Statistics Canada table: (..) for figures not available for a specific reference period and (...) for figures not applicable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,Marriages are counted in the province or territory in which they were registered. The usual place of residence of new spouses could be outside this province or territory or abroad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"Data are not available by gender in some provinces and territories starting in 2003. For that reason, gender-specific statistics for Canada are also unavailable starting in 2003.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"Nunavut came into being officially as a Territory of Canada on April 1, 1999. Data for Nunavut and Northwest Territories are presented separately starting in the year 1999.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,The legal marital status is the legal situation in regards to marriage and does not account for unmarried relationships such as common-law unions. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,"The way in which gender or sex is measured on the marriage registration forms of vital statistics registrars differs across the provinces and territories and has changed over time. Although sex and gender refer to two different concepts, the terminology related to gender is used throughout the data tables on marriage for readability. Given that the non-binary population is small, data aggregation to a two-category gender variable is sometimes necessary to protect the confidentiality of responses provided. In these cases, individuals in the category “non-binary persons” are distributed into the other two gender categories and are denoted by the “+” symbol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,Age at the last birthday preceding marriage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,Numbers of persons who married have been rounded. The rounded numbers were used in the computation of marriage rates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,"Marriage rates correspond to the number of people who married in a given year divided by the size of the unmarried population as of July 1 of the same year. For rates by age group, gender or legal marital status, both the numerator and denominator only include people of a given age group, gender and legal marital status. The demographic estimates used are the most recent available at the time of release.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
