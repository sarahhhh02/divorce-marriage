1,"Sources: Statistics Canada, Canadian Vital Statistics—Divorce Database, Canadian Vital Statistics—Marriage Database, and Estimates of population, by marital status or legal marital status, age and sex for July 1, Canada, provinces and territories.",,,,,,,,,
2,Data in this table may differ from those released previously due to updates in the data sources and methodology.,,,,,,,,,
3,The 2019 and 2020 data are considered preliminary. The number of divorces as well as divorce rates could be underestimated.,,,,,,,,,
4,Imputation was used to replace the few missing values present in the original database.,,,,,,,,,
5,This table includes all divorces granted in Canada whether the marriage was registered in Canada or another country.,,,,,,,,,
6,The following standard symbols are used in this Statistics Canada table: (..) for figures not available for a specific reference period and (...) for figures not applicable.,,,,,,,,,
7,Divorces are recorded in the province or territory in which they were granted by the courts. This generally corresponds to the place of residence of at least one spouse upon applying for divorce. Spouses may reside outside this province or territory at the time the divorce is granted.,,,,,,,,,
8,"Statistics for Northwest Territories and Nunavut are presented separately from 2000. Prior to 2000, only statistics for Northwest Territories and Nunavut combined are available. Even after 2000, however, the 30-year total divorce rate and 50-year total divorce rate are only available for both territories combined because the annual number of marriages going back 30 or 50 years, needed for the computation of these rates, is not available separately for each territory.",,,,,,,,,
9,Numbers of divorces have been rounded. The rounded numbers were used in the computation of rates and percentages.,,,,,,,,,
10,Corresponds to the number of divorces divided by the total population.,,,,,,,,,
11,"Corresponds to the number of persons who divorced in a given year divided by the size of the married population (including people who are separated but still legally married) as of July 1 of the same year. Also known as the refined divorce rate"" or the ""marital divorce rate"". Divorce rates are not presented before 1991 because estimates of the married population included people in common-law unions before that year.""",,,,,,,,,
12,"Interpreted as the divorce rate that would have been observed in a given place and year if the married population had the same age structure as a standard population. The Canadian married population as of July 1, 1991, (sexes combined) is used as the standard population. Divorce rates are not presented before 1991 because estimates of the married population included people in common-law unions before that year.",,,,,,,,,
13,The 30-year total divorce rate (TDR-30) is the sum of divorce rates by year of marriage up to 30 years of marriage. It can be interpreted as the proportion of married couples who would divorce before their 30th wedding anniversary if the duration-specific divorce rates observed for a given year remained constant. This rate does not take into account mortality and migration.,,,,,,,,,
14,The 50-year total divorce rate (TDR-50) is the sum of duration-specific divorce rates up to 50 years of marriage. It can be interpreted as the proportion of married couples who would divorce before their 50th wedding anniversary if the duration-specific divorce rates observed for a given year remained constant. This rate does not take into account mortality and migration.,,,,,,,,,
15,For marriages ending in divorce in a given year. Computed from exact durations.,,,,,,,,,
16,"The duration of divorce proceedings is defined here as the number of months between the date on which the divorce application was filed and the date on which the divorce was granted (that is, when it becomes effective).",,,,,,,,,
17,"Joint divorce applications only became possible on June 1, 1986, when a reform of the Divorce Act came into force.",,,,,,,,,
